You must upload this to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1195780) and mark the pages associated with each problem.

- For each problem, please [acknowledge your collaborators](https://anyakatsevich.github.io/sta240-s26.github.io/syllabus/syllabus_policies.html#collaboration);
- If a problem required you to code something, please include both the code and the output. "Including the code" can be as crude as a screenshot, but you might also use [Quarto](https://anyakatsevich.github.io/sta240-s26.github.io/explainers/quarto.html) to get a pdf that you can merge with the rest of your submission.
